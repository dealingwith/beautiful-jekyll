subtitle: A Chief Taco Officer

I've been working in software [since 1998](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dealingwith). My mission is to help companies ship software that delivers real value to customers.

From 2013-2020 I was a CTO of a SaaS startup. In 2020 we had a successful exit. This blog is about the lessons I learned during that time.

"Chief Taco Officer" was penned by [Aaron Quint](https://twitter.com/aq) and I shamelessly stole it when I become a CTO. I also bought a lot of tacos for my team.
